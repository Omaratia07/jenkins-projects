# 🧰 Jenkins Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Jenkins Projects Repository** — a collection of hands-on projects and practical examples for anyone learning **CI/CD automation** with Jenkins 🚀  

This repository contains multiple **FreeStyle Jobs**, **Pipeline Jobs**, and a **complete CI/CD project** that demonstrate different stages of software automation — from building and testing to containerization and deployment.

## 📁 Repository Structure

| Project Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| **ConfigureGitRepo** | FreeStyle | Demonstrates how to connect Jenkins with a Git repository and trigger builds automatically. |
| **Java-Build-Demo** | FreeStyle | Builds a simple Java Maven application using Jenkins. |
| **NodeJS-Demo** | FreeStyle | Shows how to integrate Jenkins with Node.js projects. |
| **DockerInJenkins** | FreeStyle | Demonstrates how to build Docker images directly from Jenkins. |
| **Java-Pipeline-Demo** | Pipeline | Performs the same Java Maven build process, but using a scripted Jenkins pipeline. |
| **Full-CI-CD-Project** | Pipeline | A complete CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, dockerizes, pushes to Docker Hub, and deploys to an AWS EC2 instance. |

## 🚀 Highlight: Full CI/CD Project
The `Full-CI-CD-Project` represents a complete **CI/CD automation workflow**:

1️⃣ Jenkins pulls the source code from GitHub  
2️⃣ Builds and packages the Java Maven application  
3️⃣ Builds a Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub  
4️⃣ Connects remotely to an **AWS EC2 instance**  
5️⃣ Pulls the latest image and runs the container automatically  

This project demonstrates how Jenkins can automate the entire software lifecycle from **code commit → deployment**.

📍 You can find a detailed explanation and architecture diagram in its own [README file](Full-CI-CD-Project/README.md).
